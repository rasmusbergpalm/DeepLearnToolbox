DeepLearnToolbox
================

A Matlab toolbox for Deep Learning.

Deep Learning is a new subfield of machine learning that focuses on learning deep hierarchical models of data.
It is inspired by the human brain's apparent deep (layered, hierarchical) architecture.
A good overview of the theory of Deep Learning theory is
[Learning Deep Architectures for AI](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~bengioy/papers/ftml_book.pdf)

For a more informal introduction, see the following videos by Geoffrey Hinton and Andrew Ng.

* [The Next Generation of Neural Networks](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyzOUbkUf3M) (Hinton, 2007)
* [Recent Developments in Deep Learning](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdIURAu1-aU) (Hinton, 2010)
* [Unsupervised Feature Learning and Deep Learning](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmNOAtZIgIk) (Ng, 2011)
